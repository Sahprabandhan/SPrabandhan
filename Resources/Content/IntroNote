<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="color:#FFA500"><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>The Idea</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Evolved out of a felt need that on one hand the aforesaid organizations like Producer Companies, Social Enterprises etc. owing to the nature of their work, need professional management expertise but are constrained by their operational/financial limitations. </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:18px">On the other hand, Rural Managers who have been prepared to fulfil such needs often face the difficulty in balancing their personal responsibilities versus desire to work for a cause.&nbsp;So a duality exists in this expected-versus-actuals issue.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:18px">And a solution to this issue lies in many-to-many mapping i.e. aggregation of Rural Managers to provide need-based expertise to different organizations.</span></span></p>
